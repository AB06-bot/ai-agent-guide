# NIST Guidelines Can Help Organizations Detect Face Photo Morphs, Deter Identity Fraud

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
Face morphing software can blend photos of different people’s faces into a single synthesized image. Credit: NIST Face morphing software, which can blend photos of different people’s faces into a single synthesized image, can make it easier for bad actors to bypass identity verification systems in buildings, at borders, in airports and in other settings. Morphed photos can deceive face recognition systems into falsely identifying the image as belonging to both original individuals, allowing the first individual to assume the second person’s identity and vice versa.
