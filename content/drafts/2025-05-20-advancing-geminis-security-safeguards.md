# Advancing Gemini's security safeguards

## WHAT HAPPENED
May 20, 2025 Responsibility & Safety Tailoring evaluations for adaptive attacksBaseline mitigations showed promise against basic, non-adaptive attacks, significantly reducing the attack success rate. However, malicious actors increasingly use adaptive attacks that are specifically designed to evolve and adapt with ART to circumvent the defense being tested.Successful baseline defenses like Spotlighting or Self-reflection became much less effective against adaptive attacks learning how to deal with and bypass static defense approaches.This finding illustrates a key point: relying on defenses tested only against static attacks offers a false sense of security. For robust security, it is critical to evaluate adaptive attacks that evolve in response to potential defenses.Building inherent resilience through model hardeningWhile external defenses and system-level guardrails are important, enhancing the AI model’s intrinsic ability to recognize and disregard malicious instructions embedded in data is also crucial.
