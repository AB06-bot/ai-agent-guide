# Genie 3: A new frontier for world models

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
August 5, 2025 Models Today we are announcing Genie 3, a general purpose world model that can generate an unprecedented diversity of interactive environments.Given a text prompt, Genie 3 can generate dynamic worlds that you can navigate in real time at 24 frames per second, retaining consistency for a few minutes at a resolution of 720p. Towards world simulationAt Google DeepMind, we have been pioneering research in simulated environments for over a decade, from training agents to master real-time strategy games to developing simulated environments for open-ended learning and robotics. This work motivated our development of world models, which are AI systems that can use their understanding of the world to simulate aspects of it, enabling agents to predict both how an environment will evolve and how their actions will affect it.World models are also a key stepping stone on the path to AGI, since they make it possible to train AI agents in an unlimited curriculum of rich simulation environments.
