## WHAT HAPPENED
September 17, 2025 Research Gemini 2.5 Deep Think achieves breakthrough performance at the world’s most prestigious computer programming competition, demonstrating a profound leap in abstract problem solving.An advanced version of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think has achieved gold-medal level performance at the 2025 International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) World Finals.This milestone builds directly on Gemini 2.5 Deep Think's gold-medal win at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) just two months ago. Innovations from these efforts will continue to be integrated into future versions of Gemini Deep Think, expanding the frontier of advanced AI capabilities accessible to students and researchers.Solving complex tasks at these competitions requires deep abstract reasoning, creativity, the ability to synthesize novel solutions to problems never seen before and a genuine spark of ingenuity.Together, these breakthroughs in competitive programming and mathematical reasoning demonstrate Gemini’s profound leap in abstract problem-solving — marking a significant step on our path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).ICPC sets a global standard for excellenceThe ICPC is globally recognized as the oldest, largest and most prestigious algorithmic programming competition at college level. This is a step up from high school level olympiads such as the IMO.
