# Gemini 2.0 is now available to everyone

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
In December, we kicked off the agentic era by releasing an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Flash — our highly efficient workhorse model for developers with low latency and enhanced performance. Earlier this year, we updated 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental in Google AI Studio, which improved its performance by combining Flash’s speed with the ability to reason through more complex problems.And last week, we made an updated 2.0 Flash available to all users of the Gemini app on desktop and mobile, helping everyone discover new ways to create, interact and collaborate with Gemini.Today, we’re making the updated Gemini 2.0 Flash generally available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Developers can now build production applications with 2.0 Flash.We’re also releasing an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Pro, our best model yet for coding performance and complex prompts.
