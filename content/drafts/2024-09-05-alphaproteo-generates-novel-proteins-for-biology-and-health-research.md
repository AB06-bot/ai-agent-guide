# AlphaProteo generates novel proteins for biology and health research

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
September 5, 2024 Science New AI system designs proteins that successfully bind to target molecules, with potential for advancing drug design, disease understanding and more.Every biological process in the body, from cell growth to immune responses, depends on interactions between molecules called proteins. Like a key to a lock, one protein can bind to another, helping regulate critical cellular processes. Protein structure prediction tools like AlphaFold have already given us tremendous insight into how proteins interact with each other to perform their functions, but these tools cannot create new proteins to directly manipulate those interactions.Scientists, however, can create novel proteins that successfully bind to target molecules.
