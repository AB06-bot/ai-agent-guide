# We’re expanding our Gemini 2.5 family of models

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
Jun 17, 2025 Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro are now generally available, and we’re introducing 2.5 Flash-Lite, our most cost-efficient and fastest 2.5 model yet. We designed Gemini 2.5 to be a family of hybrid reasoning models that provide amazing performance, while also being at the Pareto Frontier of cost and speed. Today, we’re taking the next step with our 2.5 Pro and Flash models by releasing them as stable and generally available.
