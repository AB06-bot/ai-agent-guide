# Our vision for building a universal AI assistant

## WHAT HAPPENED
May 20, 2025 We’re extending Gemini to become a world model that can make plans and imagine new experiences by simulating aspects of the world. In this story Project Astra's live capabilities AI that can multitask for you Over the last decade, we’ve laid a lot of the foundations for the modern AI era, from pioneering the Transformer architecture on which all large language models are based, to developing agent systems that can learn and plan like AlphaGo and AlphaZero.We’ve applied these techniques to make breakthroughs in quantum computing, mathematics, life sciences and algorithmic discovery. And we continue to double down on the breadth and depth of our fundamental research, working to invent the next big breakthroughs necessary for artificial general intelligence (AGI).This is why we’re working to extend our best multimodal foundation model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, to become a “world model” that can make plans and imagine new experiences by understanding and simulating aspects of the world, just as the brain does.We’ve been taking strides in this direction for a while, from our pioneering work training agents to master complex games like Go and StarCraft, to building Genie 2, which is capable of generating 3D simulated environments that you can interact with, from a single image prompt.Already, we can see evidence of these capabilities emerging in Gemini’s ability to use world knowledge and reasoning to represent and simulate natural environments, Veo’s deep understanding of intuitive physics, and the way Gemini Robotics teaches robots to grasp, follow instructions and adjust on the fly.Making Gemini a world model is a critical step in developing a new, more general and more useful kind of AI — a universal AI assistant.
