# Gemini Robotics 1.5 brings AI agents into the physical world

## WHAT HAPPENED
September 25, 2025 Models We’re powering an era of physical agents — enabling robots to perceive, plan, think, use tools and act to better solve complex, multi-step tasks.Earlier this year, we made incredible progress bringing Gemini's multimodal understanding into the physical world, starting with the Gemini Robotics family of models.Today, we’re taking another step towards advancing intelligent, truly general-purpose robots. We're introducing two models that unlock agentic experiences with advanced thinking:Gemini Robotics 1.5 – Our most capable vision-language-action (VLA) model turns visual information and instructions into motor commands for a robot to perform a task. This model thinks before taking action and shows its process, helping robots assess and complete complex tasks more transparently.
