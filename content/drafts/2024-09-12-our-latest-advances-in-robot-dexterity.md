# Our latest advances in robot dexterity

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
September 12, 2024 Research Two new AI systems, ALOHA Unleashed and DemoStart, help robots learn to perform complex tasks that require dexterous movementPeople perform many tasks on a daily basis, like tying shoelaces or tightening a screw. But for robots, learning these highly-dexterous tasks is incredibly difficult to get right. To make robots more useful in people’s lives, they need to get better at making contact with physical objects in dynamic environments.Today, we introduce two new papers featuring our latest artificial intelligence (AI) advances in robot dexterity research: ALOHA Unleashed which helps robots learn to perform complex and novel two-armed manipulation tasks; and DemoStart which uses simulations to improve real-world performance on a multi-fingered robotic hand.By helping robots learn from human demonstrations and translate images to action, these systems are paving the way for robots that can perform a wide variety of helpful tasks.Improving imitation learning with two robotic armsUntil now, most advanced AI robots have only been able to pick up and place objects using a single arm.
