## WHAT HAPPENED
July 19, 2024 Research Exploring AGI, the challenges of scaling and the future of multimodal generative AINext week the artificial intelligence (AI) community will come together for the 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). Running from July 21-27 in Vienna, Austria, the conference is an international platform for showcasing the latest advances, exchanging ideas and shaping the future of AI research.This year, teams from across Google DeepMind will present more than 80 research papers. At our booth, we’ll also showcase our multimodal on-device model, Gemini Nano, our new family of AI models for education called LearnLM and we’ll demo TacticAI, an AI assistant that can help with football tactics.Here we introduce some of our oral, spotlight and poster presentations: Defining the path to AGIWhat is artificial general intelligence (AGI)?
