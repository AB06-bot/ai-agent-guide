# Improved Gemini audio models for powerful voice experiences

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
Bibo Xu Director of Product Management Tara Sainath Distinguished Research Scientist Earlier this week, we introduced greater control over audio generation with an upgrade to our Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash Text-to-Speech models.But generating expressive speech is only one side of the conversation. Today, we’re releasing an updated Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio for live voice agents. This update improves the model’s ability to handle complex workflows, navigate user instructions, and hold natural conversations.Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio is now available across Google products including Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and has also started rolling out in Gemini Live and Search Live, bringing the naturalness of native audio to Search Live for the first time.
