# Bringing AI to the next generation of fusion energy

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
October 16, 2025 Science We’re partnering with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) to bring clean, safe, limitless fusion energy closer to reality.Fusion, the process that powers the sun, promises clean, abundant energy without long-lived radioactive waste. Making it work here on Earth means keeping an ionized gas, known as plasma, stable at temperatures over 100 million degrees Celsius — all within a fusion energy machine’s limits. This is a highly complex physics problem that we’re working to solve with artificial intelligence (AI).Today, we’re announcing our research partnership with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a global leader in fusion energy.
