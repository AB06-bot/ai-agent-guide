## WHAT HAPPENED
November 13, 2025 Research SIMA 2: An Agent that Plays, Reasons, and Learns With You in Virtual 3D Worlds Last year, we introduced SIMA (Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent), a generalist AI that could follow basic instructions across a wide range of virtual environments. SIMA was a crucial first step in teaching AI to translate language into meaningful action in rich, 3D worlds.Today we’re introducing SIMA 2, the next milestone in our research creating general and helpful AI agents. By integrating the advanced capabilities of our Gemini models, SIMA is evolving from an instruction-follower into an interactive gaming companion.
