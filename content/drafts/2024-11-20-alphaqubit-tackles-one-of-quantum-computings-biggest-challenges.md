## WHAT HAPPENED
Nov 20, 2024 Our new AI system accurately identifies errors inside quantum computers, helping to make this new technology more reliable. Google DeepMind and Quantum AI teams Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize drug discovery, material design and fundamental physics — that is, if we can get them to work reliably.Certain problems, which would take a conventional computer billions of years to solve, would take a quantum computer just hours. However, these new processors are more prone to noise than conventional ones.
