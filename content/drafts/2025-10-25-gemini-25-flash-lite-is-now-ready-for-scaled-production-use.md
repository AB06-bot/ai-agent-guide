## WHAT HAPPENED
JULY 22, 2025 Today, we’re releasing the stable version of Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, our fastest and lowest cost ($0.10 input per 1M, $0.40 output per 1M) model in the Gemini 2.5 model family. We built 2.5 Flash-Lite to push the frontier of intelligence per dollar, with native reasoning capabilities that can be optionally toggled on for more demanding use cases. Building on the momentum of 2.5 Pro and 2.5 Flash, this model rounds out our set of 2.5 models that are ready for scaled production use.Our most cost-efficient and fastest 2.5 model yet Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite strikes a balance between performance and cost, without compromising on quality, particularly for latency-sensitive tasks like translation and classification.Here’s what makes it stand out:Best in-class speed: Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite has lower latency than both 2.0 Flash-Lite and 2.0 Flash on a broad sample of prompts.Cost-efficiency: It’s our lowest-cost 2.5 model yet, priced at $0.10 / 1M input tokens and $0.40 output tokens, allowing you to handle large volumes of requests affordably.
