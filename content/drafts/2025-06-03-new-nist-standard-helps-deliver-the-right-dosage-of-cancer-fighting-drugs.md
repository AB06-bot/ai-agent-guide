## WHAT HAPPENED
Actinium-225 and some other radioactive elements that emit alpha rays can be transformed into cancer-fighting missiles if they are attached to molecules that seek out and attach to tumor cells. Because alpha rays dump most of their energy within extremely short distances in the human body, this radiation can be harnessed to kill cancer cells while sparing surrounding healthy tissue.
