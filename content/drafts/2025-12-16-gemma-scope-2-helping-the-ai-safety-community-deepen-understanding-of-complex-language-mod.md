# Gemma Scope 2: helping the AI safety community deepen understanding of complex language model behavior

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
December 19, 2025 Responsibility & Safety Announcing a new, open suite of tools for language model interpretabilityLarge Language Models (LLMs) are capable of incredible feats of reasoning, yet their internal decision-making processes remain largely opaque. Should a system not behave as expected, a lack of visibility into its internal workings can make it difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for its behaviour. Last year, we advanced the science of interpretability with Gemma Scope, a toolkit designed to help researchers understand the inner workings of Gemma 2, our lightweight collection of open models.Today, we are releasing Gemma Scope 2: a comprehensive, open suite of interpretability tools for all Gemma 3 model sizes, from 270M to 27B parameters.
