# FACTS Grounding: A new benchmark for evaluating the factuality of large language models

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
December 17, 2024 Responsibility & Safety Our comprehensive benchmark and online leaderboard offer a much-needed measure of how accurately LLMs ground their responses in provided source material and avoid hallucinationsLarge language models (LLMs) are transforming how we access information, yet their grip on factual accuracy remains imperfect. They can “hallucinate” false information, particularly when given complex inputs. In turn, this can erode trust in LLMs and limit their applications in the real world.Today, we’re introducing FACTS Grounding, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the ability of LLMs to generate responses that are not only factually accurate with respect to given inputs, but also sufficiently detailed to provide satisfactory answers to user queries.We hope our benchmark will spur industry-wide progress on factuality and grounding.
