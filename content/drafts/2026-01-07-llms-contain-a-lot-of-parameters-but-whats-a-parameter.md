## WHAT HAPPENED
MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next. You can read more from the series here. I am writing this because one of my editors woke up in the middle of the night and scribbled on a bedside notepad: “What is a parameter?” Unlike a lot of thoughts that hit at 4 a.m., it’s a really good question—one that goes right to the heart of how large language models work.
