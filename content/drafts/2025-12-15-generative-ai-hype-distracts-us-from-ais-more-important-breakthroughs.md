## WHAT HAPPENED
OpinionIt's a seductive distraction from the advances in AI that are most likely to improve or even save your lifeDerek BrahneyMargaret MitchellDecember 15, 2025 On April 28, 2022, at a highly anticipated concert in Spokane, Washington, the musician Paul McCartney astonished his audience with a groundbreaking application of AI: He began to perform with a lifelike depiction of his long-deceased musical partner, John Lennon. Using recent advances in audio and video processing, engineers had taken the pair’s final performance (London, 1969), separated Lennon’s voice and image from the original mix and restored them with lifelike clarity. This story is part of MIT Technology Review’s Hype Correction package, a series that resets expectations about what AI is, what it makes possible, and where we go next.
