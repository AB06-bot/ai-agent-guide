# NIST Releases Trove of Genetic Data to Spur Cancer Research

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
This image shows chromosomes in the pancreatic cancer cell line, where mixed colors indicate chromosomal rearrangements. For example, the first copy of chromosome 1 in the top left of the image is normal because both the top and bottom are yellow, but the top part of the second copy of chromosome 1 is replaced by the top part of chromosome 2 (blue) due to a rearrangement of chromosomes in the tumor. Image was created using the Kromatid KROMASURE Screen platform.
