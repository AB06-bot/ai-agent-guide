# New Technique for Measuring DNA Damage Could Improve Cancer Therapy and Radiological Emergency Response

## WHAT HAPPENED
Credit: Inez Robertson/NIST Scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed a new technology for measuring how radiation damages DNA molecules. This novel technique, which passes DNA through tiny openings called nanopores, detects radiation damage much faster and more accurately than existing methods. It could lead to improved radiation therapy for cancer and more personalized care for individuals during radiological emergencies.“With nanopore sensing, we’re not just measuring radiation damage; we’re rewriting the rules on how quickly and effectively we can respond to both cancer care and emergencies,” said NIST physical scientist Joseph Robertson.The research has now successfully completed the proof-of-concept phase, having been demonstrated in the laboratory using carefully prepared DNA in a test tube.
