# Agent Lightning: Adding reinforcement learning to AI agents without code rewrites

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
AI agents are reshaping software development, from writing code to carrying out complex instructions. Yet LLM-based agents are prone to errors and often perform poorly on complicated, multi-step tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an approach where AI systems learn to make optimal decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for their actions, improving through trial and error.
