## WHAT HAPPENED
Nov 20, 2025 We are increasing content transparency by introducing the ability to verify if an image was generated or edited by Google AI right in the Gemini app. General summary Google is launching an AI image verification tool in the Gemini app. You can now upload images to Gemini and ask if they were created or edited using Google AI.
