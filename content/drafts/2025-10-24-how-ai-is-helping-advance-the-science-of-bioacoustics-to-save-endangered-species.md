# How AI is helping advance the science of bioacoustics to save endangered species

## WHAT HAPPENED
August 7, 2025 Science Our new Perch model helps conservationists analyze audio faster to protect endangered species, from Hawaiian honeycreepers to coral reefs.One of the ways scientists protect the health of our planet’s wild ecosystems is by using microphones (or underwater hydrophones) to collect vast amounts of audio dense with vocalizations from birds, frogs, insects, whales, fish and more. These recordings can tell us a lot about the animals present in a given area, along with other clues about the health of that ecosystem. Making sense of so much data, however, remains a massive undertaking.Today, we are releasing an update to Perch, our AI model designed to help conservationists analyze bioacoustic data.
