## WHAT HAPPENED
July 25, 2024 Science Breakthrough models AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 solve advanced reasoning problems in mathematicsNote: This blog was first published on July 25, 2024. On November 12, 2025, we published the methodology behind AlphaProof in an article in NatureArtificial general intelligence (AGI) with advanced mathematical reasoning has the potential to unlock new frontiers in science and technology.We’ve made great progress building AI systems that help mathematicians discover new insights, novel algorithms and answers to open problems. But current AI systems still struggle with solving general math problems because of limitations in reasoning skills and training data.Today, we present AlphaProof, a new reinforcement-learning based system for formal math reasoning, and AlphaGeometry 2, an improved version of our geometry-solving system.
