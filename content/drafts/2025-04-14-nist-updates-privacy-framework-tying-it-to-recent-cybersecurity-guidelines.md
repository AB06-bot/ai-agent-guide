# NIST Updates Privacy Framework, Tying It to Recent Cybersecurity Guidelines

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
A draft update to the NIST Privacy Framework will enable organizations to use it seamlessly with the agency’s Cybersecurity Framework, which received its own update last year. Targeted changes to content and structure respond to stakeholder needs and make the document easier to use. NIST is soliciting feedback on the draft until June 13, 2025.
