<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
September 18, 2024 Models New video generation technology in YouTube Shorts will help millions of people realize their creative visionArtificial intelligence (AI) technologies for generating creative content are improving rapidly, but seamless ways of using them still aren’t widely available.We’re changing that, and making these incredible technologies more easily accessible to millions of creators and billions of users around the world. Over the next few months, we’re bringing our advanced generative AI models, Veo and Imagen 3, to YouTube creators through Dream Screen.From our groundbreaking Transformer architecture to years of research in diffusion models, these models are built on nearly a decade of innovation at Google and are now optimized for wide-scale use.Throughout this journey, we’ve worked closely with artists and creators and have been guided by their curiosity and feedback to ensure our technologies help more people realize their creative vision.Creators can soon generate video with Dream ScreenBy integrating Veo into Dream Screen, YouTube creators will soon be able to generate exciting backgrounds for their Shorts. Early next year, we’re also making it possible to generate 6 second standalone video clips.Starting with an initial text prompt, Dream Screen uses Imagen 3 to generate four different images.
