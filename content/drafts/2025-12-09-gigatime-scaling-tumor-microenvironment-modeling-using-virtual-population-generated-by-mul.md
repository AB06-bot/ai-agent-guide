# GigaTIME: Scaling tumor microenvironment modeling using virtual population generated by multimodal AI

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
The convergence of digital transformation and the GenAI revolution creates an unprecedented opportunity for accelerating progress in precision health. Precision immunotherapy is a poster child for this transformation. Emerging technologies such as multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) can assess internal states of individual cells along with their spatial locations, which is critical for deciphering how tumors interact with the immune system.
