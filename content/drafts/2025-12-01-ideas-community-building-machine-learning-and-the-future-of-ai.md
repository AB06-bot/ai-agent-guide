# Ideas: Community building, machine learning, and the future of AI

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
Behind every emerging technology is a great idea propelling it forward. In the Microsoft Research Podcast series Ideas, members of the research community at Microsoft discuss the beliefs that animate their research, the experiences and thinkers that inform it, and the positive human impact it targets.In 2006, three PhD students organized the Women in Machine Learning Workshop, or WiML, to provide a space for women in ML to connect and share their research. The event has been held every year since, growing in size and mission.In this episode, two of the WiML cofounders, Jenn Wortman Vaughan, a Microsoft senior principal research manager, and Hanna Wallach, a Microsoft vice president and distinguished scientist, reflect on the 20th workshop.
