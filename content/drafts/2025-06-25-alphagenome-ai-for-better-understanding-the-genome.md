# AlphaGenome: AI for better understanding the genome

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
June 25, 2025 Science Introducing a new, unifying DNA sequence model that advances regulatory variant-effect prediction and promises to shed new light on genome function — now available via API.The genome is our cellular instruction manual. It’s the complete set of DNA which guides nearly every part of a living organism, from appearance and function to growth and reproduction. Small variations in a genome’s DNA sequence can alter an organism’s response to its environment or its susceptibility to disease.
