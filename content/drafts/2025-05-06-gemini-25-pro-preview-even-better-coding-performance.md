# Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview: even better coding performance

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
MAY 6, 2025 We’ve seen developers doing amazing things with Gemini 2.5 Pro, so we decided to release an updated version a couple of weeks early to get into developers hands sooner.Today we’re excited to release Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (I/O edition). This update features even stronger coding capabilities, for you to start building with before Google I/O later this month. Expect meaningful improvements for front-end and UI development, alongside improvements in fundamental coding tasks such as transforming and editing code, and creating sophisticated agentic workflows.“We found Gemini 2.5 Pro to be the best frontier model when it comes to "capability over latency" ratio.
