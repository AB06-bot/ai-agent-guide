## WHAT HAPPENED
December 11, 2025 Responsibility & Safety Deepening our partnership with the UK AI Security Institute Today, we're announcing an expanded partnership with the UK AI Security Institute (AISI) through a new Memorandum of Understanding focused on foundational security and safety research, to help ensure artificial intelligence is developed safely and benefits everyone.The research partnership with AISI is an important part of our broader collaboration with the UK government on accelerating safe and beneficial AI progress.Building on a foundation of collaborationAI holds immense potential to benefit humanity by helping treat disease, accelerate scientific discovery, create economic prosperity and tackle climate change. For these benefits to be realised, we must put safety and responsibility at the heart of development. Evaluating our models against a broad spectrum of potential risks remains a critical part of our safety strategy, and external partnerships are an important element of this work.This is why we have partnered with the UK AISI since its inception in November 2023 to test our most capable models.
