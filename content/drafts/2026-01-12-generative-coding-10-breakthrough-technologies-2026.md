<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
AI coding tools are rapidly changing how we produce software, and the industry is embracing it—perhaps at the expense of entry-level coding jobs.January 12, 2026WHOCopilot, Cursor, Lovable, ReplitWHENNowVICHHIKA TEP/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | ADOBE STOCK Generative AI’s ability to write software code has quickly created one of the technology’s first real use cases for business. Professional software engineers and novices alike are using AI coding assistants to produce, test, edit, and debug code, reducing the amount of time it takes to complete the often tedious steps required to finish projects. And Big Tech is fully on board: AI now writes as much as 30% of Microsoft’s code and more than a quarter of Google’s, according to the heads of those companies, while Mark Zuckerberg aspires to have most of Meta’s code written by AI agents in the near future.
