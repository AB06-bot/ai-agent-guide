Their input has been guiding our state-of-the-art generative music experiments, and helping us ensure that our new generative AI tools responsibly open the doors of music creation to everyone.Today, in partnership with Google Labs, we're releasing a reimagined experience for MusicFX DJ that makes it easier for anyone to generate music, interactively, in real time.We’re also announcing updates to our music AI toolkit, called Music AI Sandbox, and highlighting our latest AI music technologies in YouTube’s Dream Track, a suite of experiments that creators can use to generate high-quality instrumentals for their Shorts and videos.
