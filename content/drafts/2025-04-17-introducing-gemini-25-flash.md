<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
APRIL 17, 2025 Tulsee Doshi Director of Product Management Gemini Today we are rolling out an early version of Gemini 2.5 Flash in preview through the Gemini API via Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Building upon the popular foundation of 2.0 Flash, this new version delivers a major upgrade in reasoning capabilities, while still prioritizing speed and cost. Gemini 2.5 Flash is our first fully hybrid reasoning model, giving developers the ability to turn thinking on or off.
