# New NIST Reference Material to Strengthen Quality Control for Biological Drugs

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
Protein-based biotherapeutics are drugs made with genetically engineered proteins. These large protein molecules can stick together during the drug manufacturing process to form particles. A team of NIST researchers, including Srivalli Telikepalli (shown here), developed a standard reference material that will help biopharmaceutical companies better detect these particles in their drug products.
