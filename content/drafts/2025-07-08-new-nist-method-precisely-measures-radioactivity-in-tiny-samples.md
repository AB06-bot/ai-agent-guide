## WHAT HAPPENED
Close-up of a superconducting sensor board containing multiple transition edge sensors (top row of squares), which detect energy released by individual radioactive decay events. Credit: M. Carlson/NIST Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have demonstrated a new and faster method for detecting and measuring the radioactivity of minuscule amounts of radioactive material.
