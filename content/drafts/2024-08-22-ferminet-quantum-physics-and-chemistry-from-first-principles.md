# FermiNet: Quantum physics and chemistry from first principles

## WHAT HAPPENED
August 22, 2024 Science Note: This blog was first published on 19 October 2020. Following the publication of our breakthrough work on excited states in Science on 22 August 2024, we’ve made minor updates and added a section below about this new phase of work.Using deep learning to solve fundamental problems in computational quantum chemistry and explore how matter interacts with lightIn an article published in Physical Review Research, we showed how deep learning can help solve the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics for real-world systems. Not only is this an important fundamental scientific question, but it also could lead to practical uses in the future, allowing researchers to prototype new materials and chemical syntheses using computer simulation before trying to make them in the lab.Our neural network architecture, FermiNet (Fermionic Neural Network), is well-suited to modeling the quantum state of large collections of electrons, the fundamental building blocks of chemical bonds.
