## WHAT HAPPENED
Using NIST's large chamber test facility, researchers are assessing how portable air cleaners impact indoor air chemistry.Credit: NIST In the wake of COVID-19 and widespread wildfires, demand skyrocketed for air cleaners, machines that could remove potentially harmful particles from the air in a home. Manufacturers responded by producing a wider variety of air cleaner devices designed for single rooms.The main purpose of an air cleaner is to, well, clean the air, making it safer and more comfortable to breathe. Yet in the process, some of these devices may also release new unwanted chemicals as a by-product.
