## WHAT HAPPENED
December 4, 2024 Science New AI model advances the prediction of weather uncertainties and risks, delivering faster, more accurate forecasts up to 15 days aheadWeather impacts all of us — shaping our decisions, our safety, and our way of life. As climate change drives more extreme weather events, accurate and trustworthy forecasts are more essential than ever. Yet, weather cannot be predicted perfectly, and forecasts are especially uncertain beyond a few days.Because a perfect weather forecast is not possible, scientists and weather agencies use probabilistic ensemble forecasts, where the model predicts a range of likely weather scenarios.
