## WHAT HAPPENED
November 19, 2025 Responsibility & Safety We’re expanding our presence in Singapore to advance AI in the Asia-Pacific region Through cutting-edge research, a growing bench of world-class talent, and deepening work with government, we'll accelerate real-world benefits and applications of AIThe Asia-Pacific region is home to more than half the world's population and is poised for immense growth. The Singapore government’s ambitious and forward-looking approach — exemplified by their National AI Strategy 2.0 and Smart Nation 2.0 and their openness to global talent — make this an excellent location to expand our presence as we open a new Google DeepMind research lab in Singapore.This investment builds on Google's longstanding commitment to the Asia-Pacific ecosystem, and follows a more-than doubling of Google DeepMind's APAC team over the past year.Advancing Gemini and frontier AI impactOur growing team in Singapore will consist of exceptional research scientists, software engineers, and AI impact experts focused on critical areas of research and development. This builds on our efforts to pioneer foundational research in linguistic and cultural inclusivity for Asia Pacific, advance Gemini's core capabilities, and apply the latest models across Google products and for Cloud customers.Our new research lab will be focused on collaboration as we work directly with government, businesses, civil society and world-class academic institutions across the region.
