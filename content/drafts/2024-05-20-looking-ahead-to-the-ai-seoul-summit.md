# Looking ahead to the AI Seoul Summit

## WHAT HAPPENED
May 20, 2024 Responsibility & Safety How summits in Seoul, France and beyond can galvanize international cooperation on frontier AI safetyLast year, the UK Government hosted the first major global Summit on frontier AI safety at Bletchley Park. It focused the world’s attention on rapid progress at the frontier of AI development and delivered concrete international action to respond to potential future risks, including the Bletchley Declaration; new AI Safety Institutes; and the International Scientific Report on Advanced AI Safety.Six months on from Bletchley, the international community has an opportunity to build on that momentum and galvanize further global cooperation at this week’s AI Seoul Summit. We share below some thoughts on how the summit – and future ones – can drive progress towards a common, global approach to frontier AI safety.AI capabilities have continued to advance at a rapid paceSince Bletchley, there has been strong innovation and progress across the entire field, including from Google DeepMind.
