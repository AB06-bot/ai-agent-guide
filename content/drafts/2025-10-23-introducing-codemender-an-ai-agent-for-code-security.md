# Introducing CodeMender: an AI agent for code security

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
October 6, 2025 Responsibility & Safety Using advanced AI to fix critical software vulnerabilitiesToday, we’re sharing early results from our research on CodeMender, a new AI-powered agent that improves code security automatically.Software vulnerabilities are notoriously difficult and time-consuming for developers to find and fix, even with traditional, automated methods like fuzzing. Our AI-based efforts like Big Sleep and OSS-Fuzz have demonstrated AI’s ability to find new zero-day vulnerabilities in well-tested software. As we achieve more breakthroughs in AI-powered vulnerability discovery, it will become increasingly difficult for humans alone to keep up.CodeMender helps solve this problem by taking a comprehensive approach to code security that’s both reactive, instantly patching new vulnerabilities, and proactive, rewriting and securing existing code and eliminating entire classes of vulnerabilities in the process.
