## WHAT HAPPENED
Hyperscale data centers are now powering AI models with a revolutionary architecture—at a staggering energy cost.January 12, 2026WHOAmazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAIWHENNowVICHHIKA TEP/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | ADOBE STOCK In sprawling stretches of farmland and industrial parks, supersized buildings packed with racks of computers are springing up to fuel the AI race. These engineering marvels are a new species of infrastructure: supercomputers designed to train and run large language models at mind-­bending scale, complete with their own specialized chips, cooling systems, and even energy supplies. Hyperscale AI data centers bundle hundreds of thousands of specialized computer chips called graphics processing units (GPUs), such as Nvidia’s H100s, into synchronized clusters that work like one giant supercomputer.
