# Mapping, modeling, and understanding nature with AI

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
November 5, 2025 Research Mapping, modeling, and understanding nature with AI AI models can help map species, protect forests and listen to birds around the worldThe planet’s biosphere is the sum of its plants, animals, fungi, and other organisms. Every day, we depend on it for our survival – the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat are all produced by Earth’s ecosystems.As increasing demand for land and resources puts pressure on these ecosystems and their species, artificial intelligence (AI) can be a transformative tool to help protect them. It can make it easier for governments, companies and conservation groups to collect field data, integrate that data into new insights, and translate those insights into action.
