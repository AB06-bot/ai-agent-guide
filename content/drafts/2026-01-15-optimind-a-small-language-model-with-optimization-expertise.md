# OptiMind: A small language model with optimization expertise

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
At a glance Many real-world business problems can benefit from optimization, but translating decisions, constraints, and goals from natural language into optimization algorithms is slow. OptiMind is a small language model designed to convert business problems described in natural language into the mathematical formulations needed by optimization software. OptiMind is trained on a carefully curated, expert-aligned dataset and applies domain-specific hints and self-checks at inference time, improving its accuracy.
