# AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
May 14, 2025 Science New AI agent evolves algorithms for math and practical applications in computing by combining the creativity of large language models with automated evaluatorsLarge language models (LLMs) are remarkably versatile. They can summarize documents, generate code or even brainstorm new ideas. And now we’ve expanded these capabilities to target fundamental and highly complex problems in mathematics and modern computing.Today, we’re announcing AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models for general-purpose algorithm discovery and optimization.
