# Music AI Sandbox, now with new features and broader access

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
April 24, 2025 Models Musicians today are drawing inspiration and crafting their sound using a broad ecosystem of tools — from mobile apps to traditional Digital Audio Workstations, specialized plug-ins and hardware. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a powerful new part of this creative toolkit, opening doors to novel workflows and sonic possibilities.Google has long collaborated with musicians, producers, and artists in the research and development of music AI tools. Ever since launching the Magenta project, in 2016, we’ve been exploring how AI can enhance creativity — sparking inspiration, facilitating exploration and enabling new forms of expression, always hand-in-hand with the music community.Our ongoing collaborations led to the creation of Music AI Sandbox, in 2023, which we’ve shared with musicians, producers and songwriters through YouTube’s Music AI Incubator.Building upon the work we've done to date, today, we're introducing new features and improvements to Music AI Sandbox, including Lyria 2, our latest music generation model.
