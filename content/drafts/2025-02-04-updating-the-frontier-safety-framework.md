# Updating the Frontier Safety Framework

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
February 4, 2025 Responsibility & Safety Our next iteration of the FSF sets out stronger security protocols on the path to AGIAI is a powerful tool that is helping to unlock new breakthroughs and make significant progress on some of the biggest challenges of our time, from climate change to drug discovery. But as its development progresses, advanced capabilities may present new risks.That’s why we introduced the first iteration of our Frontier Safety Framework last year - a set of protocols to help us stay ahead of possible severe risks from powerful frontier AI models. Since then, we've collaborated with experts in industry, academia, and government to deepen our understanding of the risks, the empirical evaluations to test for them, and the mitigations we can apply.
