## WHAT HAPPENED
June 12, 2025 Research We’re launching Weather Lab, featuring our experimental cyclone predictions, and we’re partnering with the U.S. National Hurricane Center to support their forecasts and warnings this cyclone season.Tropical cyclones are extremely dangerous, endangering lives and devastating communities in their wake. And in the past 50 years, they’ve caused $1.4 trillion in economic losses.These vast, rotating storms, also known as hurricanes or typhoons, form over warm ocean waters — fueled by heat, moisture and convection.
