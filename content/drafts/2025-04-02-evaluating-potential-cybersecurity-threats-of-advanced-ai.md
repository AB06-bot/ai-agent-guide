<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
April 2, 2025 Responsibility & Safety Evaluating potential cybersecurity threats of advanced AI Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been a cornerstone of cybersecurity. From malware detection to network traffic analysis, predictive machine learning models and other narrow AI applications have been used in cybersecurity for decades. As we move closer to artificial general intelligence (AGI), AI's potential to automate defenses and fix vulnerabilities becomes even more powerful.But to harness such benefits, we must also understand and mitigate the risks of increasingly advanced AI being misused to enable or enhance cyberattacks.
