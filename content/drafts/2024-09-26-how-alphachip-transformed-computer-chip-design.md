# How AlphaChip transformed computer chip design

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
September 26, 2024 Science Our AI method has accelerated and optimized chip design, and its superhuman chip layouts are used in hardware around the worldIn 2020, we released a preprint introducing our novel reinforcement learning method for designing chip layouts, which we later published in Nature and open sourced.Today, we’re publishing a Nature addendum that describes more about our method and its impact on the field of chip design. We’re also releasing a pre-trained checkpoint, sharing the model weights and announcing its name: AlphaChip.Computer chips have fueled remarkable progress in artificial intelligence (AI), and AlphaChip returns the favor by using AI to accelerate and optimize chip design. The method has been used to design superhuman chip layouts in the last three generations of Google’s custom AI accelerator, the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).AlphaChip was one of the first reinforcement learning approaches used to solve a real-world engineering problem.
