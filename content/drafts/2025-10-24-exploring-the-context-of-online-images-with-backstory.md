# Exploring the context of online images with Backstory

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
July 21, 2025 Responsibility & Safety New experimental AI tool helps people explore the context and origin of images seen online.The ways people are using and interacting with images online is constantly evolving. Last year, we published a paper on determining trustworthiness through context and provenance, showing how better assessment tools can empower people to make informed decisions about what they’re seeing on the internet.As part of our efforts to help people make informed choices, we’re developing easy-to-use provenance tools and in-product context features, and investing in areas like information literacy.Today, we’re introducing Backstory, an experimental artificial intelligence (AI) tool that surfaces information and helps people learn more about the context of images seen online.When given an image and a written prompt, Backstory investigates whether an image was AI-generated, when and where it’s previously been used online, and whether it’s been digitally altered. It quickly equips users with helpful information, responds to further prompts, describes whether and how an image has been used, and how its story may have changed over time.
