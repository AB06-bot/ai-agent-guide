<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
Oct 15, 2025 We’re launching a new 27 billion parameter foundation model for single-cell analysis built on the Gemma family of open models. Shekoofeh Azizi Staff Research Scientist, Research Lead, Google DeepMind Bryan Perozzi Senior Staff Research Scientist, Graph Mining, Google Research General summary Google DeepMind and Yale created C2S-Scale a new model built on the Gemma family of open models. This model identified a drug combination that may make tumors more visible to the immune system, offering a new cancer therapy approach.
