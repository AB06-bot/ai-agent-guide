# AlphaFold: Five years of impact

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
November 25, 2025 Science Since 2020, AlphaFold has accelerated the pace of science and fueled a global wave of biological discovery — an achievement recognized with a Nobel PrizeFive years ago, AlphaFold 2 solved the protein structure prediction problem, unlocking new avenues of biological research and providing our first major proof point that AI can be a powerful tool to advance science.Proteins are the complex, microscopic machines that drive every process in a living cell. Composed of long, unique chains of amino acids, they precisely fold into a 3D structure that largely defines the protein’s function - making knowledge of this shape critical for drug discovery and understanding disease. p53 is a cellular tumor antigen related to diseases such as cancer.
