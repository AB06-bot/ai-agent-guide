# Champlain Towers South Investigation Nears Completion of Technical Work

<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
The NIST National Construction Safety Team analyzed photographs, building maintenance records, and eyewitness reports to develop this graphic showing where cracks had been identified in the first-floor slab in the months and years before the 2021 partial collapse of Champlain Towers South. The cracks are noted in turquoise, while construction joints (where concrete slabs meet) that are of interest to the investigation are shown in pink. Note the concentration of cracks in the street-level parking and pool decks.
