<!-- HERO_IMAGE: add an editorial image URL or local path here -->

## WHAT HAPPENED
As a world leader in connected LED lighting products, systems, and services, Signify (formerly Philips Lighting) serves not only everyday consumers but also a large number of professional users who have stringent requirements for technical specifications and engineering compatibility. Faced with thousands of product models, complex component parameters, and technical documentation spanning multiple versions, delivering accurate, professional answers efficiently has become a core challenge for Signify’s knowledge management system. To address this challenge, Signify (opens in new tab) collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia on a proof-of-concept (PoC) using PIKE-RAG technology, integrating it into their upgraded knowledge management system built on Microsoft Azure.
