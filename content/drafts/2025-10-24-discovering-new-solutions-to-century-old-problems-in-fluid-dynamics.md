## WHAT HAPPENED
September 18, 2025 Science Our new method could help mathematicians leverage AI techniques to tackle long-standing challenges in mathematics, physics and engineering.For centuries, mathematicians have developed complex equations to describe the fundamental physics involved in fluid dynamics. These laws govern everything from the swirling vortex of a hurricane to airflow lifting an airplane’s wing.Experts can carefully craft scenarios that make theory go against practice, leading to situations which could never physically happen. These situations, such as when quantities like velocity or pressure become infinite, are called ‘singularities’ or ‘blow ups’.
